The goal of this project is to
	Determine player 1 from the button/keyboard press on the title screen
	Select a profile
	Allow other players to join from the main menu
		Allow profile selection when joined

	Think of the rock band menu at the bottom of the screen

	[Player 1][Player 2      ][Player 3   ][Player 4]
	[L       ][C             ][Press Start][Press Start]
	          [Change Profile]
			  [Control: GamePad | Keyboard]
	          [Leave         ]



	Have a main menu to select the game

		Game: <- L.T. -> | <- Dr. L.io -> | ...
			Changing the game should change the background
			Should be able to cycle through all the games
			Or just a couple options at the top

			L.T.
			Dr. L.io
			Options
			Exit

	Below that have an options menu

		Options:
			Video:
			Audio:
			Controls:

		Exit:


	Main menu - anyone can select, or player 1 can select
	Choose speed menu - all players control their parts of the menu
	Player menu - anyone can open player menu, and they control that menu
				- if multiple players in grid, any player on grid can control menu

	
	    //menu controls
    //static text, image (could be animated)
    //slider (volume) (or incrementing/decrementing values)
    //chooser (resolutions, profile names) (list, left/right arrows)
    //radio buttons / group chooser
    //check box / boolean
    //action (close menu, open submenu, start game, 
    //  technically with multiple menu states, this is 
    //  just a push/pop state

//choices need to be dynamic or static lists
// resolutions, num players, etc

//actions when item changes - set volume
//actions when button pressed - apply res changes
//  technically apply should be a new state that reverts
//  if there is a problem
